(I might be a little off on the title, but he \\n->writes the book.  Anyway he was part of an effort to destroy Christianity, \\n->in the process he became a Christian himself.\\n\\nSounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy.  Just what organization did he \\nbelong to? Does it have a name?\\n\\n->\\tThe book says that Jesus was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a \\n->modern day Koresh) or he was actually who he said he was.\\n\\nLogic alert - artificial trifercation.  The are many other possible explainations.  Could have been\\nthat he never existed.  There have been some good points made in this group that is not \\nimpossible  that JC is an amalgam of a number of different myths, Mithra comes to mind.\\n\\n->\\tSome reasons why he wouldn\\'t be a liar are as follows.  Who would \\n->die for a lie?  Wouldn\\'t people be able to tell if he was a liar?  People \\n->gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing \\n->someone who was or had been healed.

Liars can be very pursuasive, just look at Koresh that you yourself site.\\nHe has followers that don\\'t think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die.\\nBy not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what \\nhe believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not\\nconsistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more \\nthat faith healers can pull off today.  Seems to me that the early gospels weren\\'t that compeling,\\nso the stories got bigger to appeal better.\\n\\n->\\tNiether was he a lunatic.  Would more than an entire nation be drawn \\n->to someone who was crazy.  Very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  For example \\n->anyone who is drawn to David Koresh is obviously a fool, logical people see \\n->this right away.\\n->\\tTherefore since he wasn\\'t a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the \\n->real thing.  \\n\\n\\nOr might not have existed, or any number of things.  That is the logical pitfall that those who\\nuse flawed logic like this fall into.

Once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are, then arguments among\\nthe alternatives can be presentent, and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding\\nall other possible alternatives.\\n\\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the \\nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.  I have given at \\nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC is the real McCoy just because he isn\\'t one of\\nthe other two alternative is no longer valid.\\n\\n->\\tSome other things to note.  He fulfilled loads of prophecies in \\n->the psalms, Isaiah and elsewhere in 24 hrs alone.  This in his betrayal \\n->and Crucifixion.  I don\\'t have my Bible with me at this moment, next time I \\n->write I will use it.\\n\\nJC was a rabbi.  He knew what those prophecies were.  It wouldn\\'t be any great shakes to make\\nsure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy.  What would be compeling is if there\\nwere a set of clear and explicit prophecies AND JC had absolutely NO knowledge of then,  yet \\nfullfilled them anyway.\\n\\n->\\tI don\\'t think most people understand what a Christian is.  It \\n->is certainly not what I see a lot in churches.  Rather I think it \\n->should be a way of life, and a total sacrafice of everything for God\\'s \\n->sake.  He loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the \\n->same.  Hey we can\\'t do it, God himself inspires us to turn our lives \\n->over to him.  That\\'s tuff and most people don\\'t want to do it, to be a \\n->real Christian would be something for the strong to persevere at.

       " '\\n\\nYou misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements about\\nhis lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book\\n\"Orientalism\" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian,\\nnot a Muslim.\\n\\n\\nRegarding Bernard Lewis:\\n\\nHim being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his\\ngiving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.\\n\\nRead \"Orientalism\" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.\\n\\nIn fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn\\'t too long).\\n\\n\\nI haven\\'t read Lewis\\'s article, so I can\\'t comment directly upon it, and\\nhave only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his\\npolitical motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic\\npolemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based\\non telling half-truths.\\n\\nAgain, read \"Orientalism\" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take\\nwhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get\\nthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for\\n_yourself_.\\n\\n\\nIf slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some\\nMuslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual\\npurposes is necessarily opposed too.\\n\\n\\nI understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_\\nwho are not getting through to _you_.\\n\\nSome of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.\\n\\nRegarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,\\nshowing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been\\ncompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a\\nvery good one, under the title \"Islam and Women\", reposted from\\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur\\'an and contains numerous Qur\\'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\\'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\\nhave.',\n",

The number of characters\\nX       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or }\\nX       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536.\\nX\\nX    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format:\\nX\\nX---entry---\\nXrule:\\t1993\\nXfix:\\ty or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry)\\nXtitle:\\ttitle of entry  \\t\\t    (see comments below)\\nXentry:\\tEntry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0)\\nXdate:\\tDate/time of submission in UTC\\t    (see comments below)\\nXhost:\\tMachine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested\\nX\\tUse tab indented lines if needed\\nX---remark---\\nX    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if\\nX    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a\\nX    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th\\nX    column.  Blank lines are permitted.\\nX---author---\\nXname:\\tyour name\\nXorg:\\tSchool/Company/Organization\\nXaddr:\\tpostal address\\nX\\tuse tab indented lines to continue\\nX\\tdon\\'t forget to include the country\\nXemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain.\\nX        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines.\\nXanon:\\ty or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info)\\nX---info---\\nXIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in\\nXthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info\\nXsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section.\\nX---build---\\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program\\nXin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named \\'build\\'.  The resulting\\nXfile must be 255 bytes or less.\\nX---program---\\nXPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode\\nXinto a file named is \\'prog.c\\'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2.\\nX---end---\\nX\\nX      Regarding the above format:\\nX\\nX\\t* The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]*\\nX\\t  and must be 1 to 12 characters in length.\\nX\\nX\\t  It is suggested, but not required, that the title should\\nX\\t  incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors,\\nX\\t  consider using parts of the usernames of the authors.\\nX\\nX\\t* The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect\\nX\\t  to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime() \\nX\\t  using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info)\\nX\\nX\\t* You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending\\nX\\t  it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set \\'fix\\' in the \\nX\\t  ---entry--- section to \\'n\\'.  The corrected entry must use the same \\nX\\t  title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be \\nX\\t  sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well.\\nX\\nX\\t* With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above \\nX\\t  format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges\\nX\\t  something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate\\nX\\t  Email message to the judges.\\nX\\nX\\t* Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless \\nX\\t  \\'y\\' was given to the respective author\\'s \\'anon\\' line.\\nX\\nX\\t* To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for\\nX\\t  each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and\\nX\\t  should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections.\\nX\\nX\\t* The entry\\'s remarks should include:\\nX\\t    - what this program does\\nX\\t    - how to run the program (sample args or input)\\nX\\t    - special compile or execution instructions, if any\\nX\\t    - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5)\\nX\\t    - information about any ---data--- files\\nX\\t    - why you think the program is obfuscated\\nX\\t    - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry.\\nX\\t    - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise)\\nX\\nX\\t* Do not rot13 your entry\\'s remarks.  You may suggest that certain\\nX\\t  portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award.\\nX\\nX        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They \\nX\\t  should not be required to exist.\\nX\\nX\\t  If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info---\\nX\\t  section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple \\nX\\t  ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe\\nX\\t  each info file in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows:\\nX\\nX\\t   \\'build\\' is incorporated into a makefile, and \\'build\\' is removed\\nX\\t   \\'prog.c\\' is renamed to your entry\\'s title, followed by an optional\\nX\\t       digit, followed by \\'.c\\'\\nX\\t   your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry\\'s\\nX\\t       title, possibly followed by a digit\\nX\\nX       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your\\nX       entry\\'s remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a\\nX       build shell script containing the \\'build\\' information.  The name of\\nX       this build shell script will be your entry\\'s title, possibly followed\\nX       by a digit, followed by \\'.sh\\'.\\nX\\nX       If needed, your entry\\'s remarks should indicate how your entry must\\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\\nX\\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\\nX       occurs, state so in your entry\\'s remarks.\\nX\\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not \\nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\\nX\\nX    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the\\nX       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected.\\nX\\nX    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\\nX\\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\\nX\\nX\\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\\nX\\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\\nX\\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers \\nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with \\nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor \\nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\\nX\\nX\\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\\nX\\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\\nX\\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\\nX    might be \\'old\\' the next year.\\nX\\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\\nX\\nX\\t* look at the original source\\nX\\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \\'#include\\' lines\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \\'#define\\' and \\'#include\\' lines\\nX\\t* run it through a C beautifier\\nX\\t* examine the algorithm\\nX\\t* lint it\\nX\\t* compile it\\nX\\t* execute it\\nX\\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\\nX    \\'cleaned up\\' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\\nX\\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\\nX    \\'strangest/most creative source layout\\' need not do as well as\\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\\nX\\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award \\'worst abuse of the\\nX    rules\\' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\\nX\\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\\nX    annoy more than amuse.\\nX\\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award \\'worst abuse of the rules\\'\\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\\nX\\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn\\'t work.\\nX\\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\\nX    working entry is best.\\nX\\nX\\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\\nX\\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become \\'old\\'.  We\\nX    tend to \\'see thru\\' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won\\'t go as far\\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\\nX\\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\\nX\\nX\\t#define d define\\nX\\t#d foo\\t\\t   <-- don\\'t expect this to turn into #define foo\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tj;\\t\\t   <-- don\\'t use such implicit type declaration\\nX\\tint k;\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you \\nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in \\nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\\nX\\nX    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type.\\nX    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed:\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tchar *c;\\nX\\ti[c];\\t\\t   <--- use c[i] instead\\nX\\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\\nX\\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\\nX    not portable and must not be used:\\nX\\nX\\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\\nX\\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\\nX\\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\\nX\\t* using va_list as a structure or union\\nX\\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **\\'s.\\nX\\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\\nX\\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\\nX    the leading \\'#\\' must be the first character on a line.  While some\\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading \\'#\\', many do not.\\nX\\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\\nX\\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\\nX\\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\\nX\\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\\nX\\nX\\t* are very hardware specific\\nX\\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\\nX\\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\\nX\\t      code is likely not to be)\\nX\\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\\nX\\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the \\'remark\\' header item)\\nX\\t* won\\'t compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\\nX\\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\\nX\\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\\nX\\t* are longer than they need to be\\nX\\t* are similar to previous winners\\nX\\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\\nX\\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\\nX    \\'best one liner\\' category, we suggest that you format your program\\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\\nX\\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D\\'s to help out,\\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D\\'s in order to\\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\\nX\\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\\nX\\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the \\'smallest self-replicating\\'\\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of \\'smallest\\', lest we (or others)\\nX    know of a smaller one!\\nX\\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don\\'t\\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don\\'t depend\\nX    on color or a given size.  Don\\'t require backing store.\\nX\\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\\nX    Don\\'t use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\\nX\\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    We like programs that:\\nX\\nX\\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\\nX\\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\\nX\\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\\nX\\t* are portable\\nX\\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\\nX\\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\\nX\\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\\nX\\nX    Some types of programs can\\'t excel in some areas.  Of course, your\\nX    program doesn\\'t have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\\nX    areas really does help.\\nX\\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\\nX\\nX    Be creative!\\nX\\nX\\nXENTRY FORMAT:\\nX\\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\\nX\\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\\nX\\nX\\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\\nX\\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\\nX\\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\\nX\\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\\nX\\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\\nX\\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\\nX\\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.

If this case applies, it would be be helpful\\nX    if you did one of the following:\\nX\\nX\\t* Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.\\nX\\nX\\t* Have the build file make copies of the files.

Send us a version of \\nX\\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You \\nX\\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\\nX\\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\\nX    \\'hints\\' file.\\nX\\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\\nX\\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\\nX    have entry number 0.\\nX\\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don\\'t place text outside of the\\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren\\'t\\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the \\nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\\nX\\nX\\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\\t(not the address for\\nX\\tjudges@toad.com\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t submitting entries)\\nX    \\nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer \\nX    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as \\nX    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is:\\nX\\nX\\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\\nX\\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.

To do so, set\\nX    the \\'fix\\' line in the ---entry--- section to \\'y\\' instead of \\'n\\'.\\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\\nX    replaced.\\nX\\nX\\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\\nX\\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\\nX\\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\\nX\\nX\\t---entry--- section\\nX\\tall ---author--- sections\\nX\\tall ---info--- sections\\nX\\t---build--- section\\nX\\t---program--- section\\nX\\tany other text, including the Email message headers\\nX\\nX    Prior to judging, the \\'any other text\\' file is scanned to be sure\\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\\nX\\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\\nX\\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\\nX    Because the main \\'prize\\' of winning is being announced, we make all\\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\\nX    winners at talks)\\nX\\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\\nX\\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\\nX\\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\\nX\\nX\\t* reading the ---entry--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\\nX\\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\\nX\\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\\nX\\nX\\t* linting the source\\nX\\t* compiling/building the source\\nX\\t* running the program\\nX\\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\\nX\\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\\nX\\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\\nX\\nX\\t* best small one line program\\nX\\t* best small program\\nX\\t* strangest/most creative source layout\\nX\\t* most useful obfuscated program\\nX\\t* best game that is obfuscated\\nX\\t* most creatively obfuscated program\\nX\\t* most deceptive C code\\nX\\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\\nX\\t* best abuse of ANSI C\\nX\\t* worst abuse of the rules\\nX\\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\\nX\\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\\nX\\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\\nX    less clear cut.\\nX\\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry \\nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course, \\nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\\nX\\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\\nX    rules in some way.\\nX\\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as \\'best\\'.  Sometimes such\\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\\nX    \\'best\\' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\\nX\\nX\\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\\nX\\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition,\\nX    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to\\nX    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF.\\nX\\nX    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups:\\nX\\nX\\t    comp.lang.c\\t\\t  comp.unix.wizards\\talt.sources\\nX\\nX    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following\\nX\\nX\\t    comp.sources.d\\t  alt.sources.d\\t\\tmisc.misc\\nX\\t    comp.sources.misc\\t  comp.windows.x\\nX\\nX    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.

This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual\\nphysical objects.\\n\\n2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the\\ncopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a\\ndocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something\\nfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several\\ngenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still \\nbe tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot\\nexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so\\nwe must confine our testing to the text itself.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if\\nthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the\\ndocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I\\'ve heard\\nof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king\\nin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up\\nscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the\\nholograph).  They could check the language, content and writing\\nstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a\\nPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were\\npositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually\\nwrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but\\n(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for \\ncomparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to\\ndetermine who the actual author was.\\n\\nAs I say, I\\'m no expert on Blas\\'s work.  I do remember some of the\\ntests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  \\nSpecifically we might ask:\\n\\n1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict\\nitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to \\nmaintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The \\nlonger the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.\\nFor this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.\\n\\n2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?\\nAgain a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the\\nwriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be\\nable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous\\nthings which someone from that culture would get right without even\\nthinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous \\nand trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.\\n\\n3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech\\netc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that \\nseem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  \\nIf so do they fit in with the culture?\\n\\nOf course there are complications if the document has been\\ntranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language\\nwhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture\\nclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and\\nreduce certainty to be sure but don\\'t necessarily prove forgery.\\n\\nThese tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work \\nwith) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the \\nhistorian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to \\nask are, \"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we \\nknow about the culture of claimed origin?\"  If there are things \\nwhich don\\'t fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to\\nour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really \\nsignificant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never\\nknow everything about the culture.',\n",

       " 'Subject: Re: Eugenics\\n/\\n;Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible. \\n;Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will \\n;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic\\n;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.\\n;No breeding, no \"hybrids\", etc.  The ethical question is, should\\n;we?\\n \\nTwo past problems with eugenics have been \\n1) reducing the gene pool and \\n2) defining the status of the eugenized.\\n \\nInserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted\\ngenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to\\ncrowd out \"garbage genes.\" This may in the future become possible. Even if\\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\\ndon\\'t really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \\n \\nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\\nas no different than anyone else\\'s. But if we could make\\n\"philosopher-kings\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\\nwant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their\\nkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually\\nrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,\\nit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\\n\"1984.\"   \\n \\nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\\nhasn\\'t stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\\npower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the\\nfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their\\nturns came.\\n \\nNot that I don\\'t think that this gene altering power couldn\\'t wipe us off\\nthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global\\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \\n \\nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don\\'t think\\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\\nmay not. If we don\\'t, I hope there are reservoirs of \"garbage\" people out\\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded \"garbage\" genes which will\\npull us through. \\n \\nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\\nthus far, or else haven\\'t had enough power for long enough. \\n \\nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\\ntechnology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in\\nsome ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn\\'t the power, it is the\\nSpirit.\\n \\nSorry for the long post. Got carried away.',\n",

I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture\\nusing a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot\\nquicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one\\n(1.5).\\n\\n   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite\\nnicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by\\n3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it\\nwasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he\\nincreased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. \\n\\n   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know\\nwhat model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime\\ncould play back at the same speed even on an LCII.\\n\\n   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having\\na little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was\\nfrom memory!\\n\\n   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some\\nhardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the \\nanimation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?\\n\\n   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.\\n\\n   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can\\nclaim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in \\nmy computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.\\n\\n   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer\\nlow-priced box has a lot of market...

Can we perhaps as the\\nquestion of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal\\nto the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written\\nwith something else in mind and \"propoganda\" put out by its supporters.\\n\\n       But let\\'s be honest about something, here.  When was the last time\\nyou brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?\\n\\n       Or are they simply propogranda?  We can\\'t know what Phill *really*\\nmeans because he\\'s obviously using arguments designed to convince.\\n\\n\\n       If they\\'re true or false, regardles of why they were said, why\\non earth did you make a point of calling them \"propogranda?\"  That\\nwould seem to be irrelevent.\\n\\n\\n       Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don\\'t believe\\nthey no longer apply, but that\\'s because I think most of them were\\ngood arguments.  I\\'m not entirely happy about the situation, because\\nthey were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don\\'t\\nthink that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.\\n\\n\\n       Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political\\nsystem, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this\\nparticular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure\\nand tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)\\n\\n\\n        In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have\\nhad less power?\\n\\n\\n        Phill, we\\'re discusing the power of legislative houses.  While\\nthe Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although\\nbadly) to the U.S. President.\\n\\n        Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives\\nis \"in principle\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)\\nbut in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the\\nConstitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh\\ndarn the thing was ratified before they realized they\\'d forgotten to put\\nthose extra restrictions on the Senate in?\\n\\n\\n      Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell\\nyou, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of\\ngovernment to \"attack\" which presents them with the best chance of\\ngetting what they want.  With national \"interest groups\" it is simply\\na very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a\\nlaw rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less \\n\"contributions\" to make.  \\n\\n      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at\\nthe Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little\\nstate battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,\\nmedicine, and most other questions.\\n\\n      Local government has not \"failed\" in that it hasn\\'t done what it\\nshould, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local\\ninterests who want localities to abide by their rules can\\'t get their\\nrules past the local government.  Thus, since they\\'ve got more clout,\\nonly in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because\\nit can impose its will on the lower.\\n\\n      I mean, let\\'s get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres\\nof the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-\\nand such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed\\nto a local crime?\\n\\n      The more people want the more Congress will take power to \"sell\"\\nit to them for their votes.  I don\\'t think the rise of \"special interests\"\\nis coincidence with the increased power of Congress.\\n\\n\\n       Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual\\nneed matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher\\nlevels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to\\nin effectiveness.\\n\\n\\n       Then why not simply leave New York\\'s education to New York?  I\\nremain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable\\nof educating its own children if that\\'s what they want to do.  And if\\nyou leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \"pork\" in that\\nstate.  And since industries can\\'t concentrate their political power\\nand wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get\\nwhat they want, individual voices have more relative impact.\\n\\n       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \"buy off\"\\nstates, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.\\n\\n\\n       But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself \\nthat you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres\\nhas less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact\\nnational legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem\\nis significantly reduced.\\n\\n\\n       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable\\nto action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering\\nthe government the usually the institution with the sole power to\\nenforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those\\ndecisions a good thing.\\n\\n\\n       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have\\nmore legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution\\nthan the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is\\nharder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing\\nnew deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out\\nwithout a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the\\nentire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different\\nareas, different solutions may be called for.\\n\\n       And while I often don\\'t agree with the decisions my local\\nand state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to\\nthe city council and shooting my mouth off.  I\\'d much rather the\\nmajority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end\\nup having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in\\nWashington with half a million or more constituents.\\n\\n       I\\'m curious what you base your assumption that lower levels\\nare more corrupt.  \\n\\n\\n       Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were\\narguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators\\nshould be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was\\nsuppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was\\nnothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.\\nWhich was when you brought up that we can\\'t decide what the founders\\nwanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,\\nI never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,\\nwhich places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for\\nthe House.\\n\\n\\n       The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration\\nof Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other\\nexamples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the\\nreasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)\\n\\n\\n       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something\\nit wasn\\'t intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering\\nthe Congress\\' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they\\nwant them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn\\'t be worrying\\nabout the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which\\nalmost necessitates its abuse.\\n\\n\\n       *BUSH?*  Phill, that\\'s absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of\\nwhich was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that\\'s\\nanything resembling a record.\\n\\n\\n       Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system\\nagainst action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when\\ndealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have\\nnot been successful.  When you\\'re in a position of imposing federal\\npower on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to\\ngot through something more than a bare majority\\n\\n\\n       Now we\\'re switching from a general question of a fillibuster\\nto a specific bill.  I don\\'t see how it make a difference.\\n\\n\\n       Sure it\\'s arguable.  Theyr\\'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring\\n60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they\\'ll have to have a *good*\\nargument.  Something that isn\\'t based solely on party lines.\\n\\n\\n       No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority\\nfor *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population\\ngroups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities\\nshould have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough\\nabout.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don\\'t advocate the minority\\nbeing capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing\\nthe *federal* system against action.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nOK, here\\'s at least one Christian\\'s answer:\\n\\nJesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes\\nsense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or\\nthe Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesus lived\\nunder the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises\\nof the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey\\nGod\\'s purposes.\\n\\nVerse 18 says \"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass\\naway, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,\\nuntil all is accomplished.\"  The key to this verse IMHO is the last \\nphrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplished\" what the \\nLaw was supposed to accomplish.  \\n\\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,\\nand so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;\\nbut whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the\\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish \\npeople about living lives under the law, this makes sense.\\n\\nIn general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he \\nmust have received about \"doing away with the Law.\"  That was not \\nJesus\\' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it \\nshould be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his \\npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \\nheel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be \"doing \\naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the traditions of men as \\nequal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious \\nleaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only \\nGod\\'s Law.\\n\\nIn the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law \\nand defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon \\non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people \\nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which \\nhad been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.\\n\\nIn Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the \\nLaw in this way:\\n\\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being \\nshut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore \\nthe Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be \\njustified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no \\nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith \\nin Christ Jesus.\\n\\nI believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had \\nserved it\\'s purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead us to Christ,\" and\\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law has been \"fulfilled\" \\nas Christ said he would do.\\n\\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same\\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\\nwill and testament\" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. \\nIt makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are\\nre-expressed in Christianity. \\n\\nOn the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it\\'s purpose and \\nChristians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes \\nsense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to \\nrepresent the \"mysteries\" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \\nrepresenting Christ\\'s death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\\nThe Lord\\'s supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\\nSunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\\nActs 20:7)\\n\\nOK, That\\'s one Christian\\'s explanation.

Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include\\nattitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things\\nlike thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro\\ndata from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you\\ndon't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible\\ncontamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get\\nto worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is\\ndone and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for\\nthe duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from\\nthrusters and the like).\\n\\nThe original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the\\nreboost.

       " '\\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n\\n       The \"used to kill\" is the heart of the misinformation.  It\\'s one\\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I\\'m sure, is that when people\\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\\n\\n       Unfortunately, that\\'s not the way things stack up.  The majority\\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \\nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \\nthemselves.  And why it\\'s popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\\nthe evidence doesn\\'t support this.  Internal studies, as well as\\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\\npeople jump off buildings.)\\n\\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \\nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn\\'t mean they\\nweren\\'t trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\\nkid might.\\n\\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there\\'s an enormous\\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\\nkilled.\\n\\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \"friend\\nor family member\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\\nbusinesses.)\\n\\n\\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can\\'t comment.  I\\nwill point out Canada\\'s and Japan\\'s suicide rate as indications that\\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\\n\\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\\nit\\'s worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \\nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.\\n',\n",

So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.\\n\\nThe two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc, they seem to be the two\\ntoolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if\\nanyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).\\n\\nA couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:\\n\\nZApp\\n----\\n  Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and\\n    also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.\\n  Has new fancy 3D-style controls available, and support for custom controls.\\n  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)\\n  Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)\\n  Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.\\n  Seems to be the newcomer, this could be an advantage in designing a better system.\\n \\nZinc\\n----\\n  Has a platform independent resource strategy.  (Not too important for me right now)\\n  Comes with a interface builder tool\\n  Has a Windows NT version (Essential)\\n  Seems to have been around longer (more mature), but grew up out of a DOS version.  \\n  Had a better demo :-)\\n\\nBoth have source code availability options\\nBoth are lacking OLE support\\nNeither seem to have any particular support for multimedia type stuff\\n\\n\\nAny thoughts anyone has on this would be much appreciated,\\n\\nThanks,\\n  Brett Harper\\n\",\n",

Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian\\nwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.\\n\\n\\n(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing\\nwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I\\'ve set all followups to sci.med\\nsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I\\'m sure most of the\\nreplies, if any, will be med-related.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\\nOops, that is not a recognized \"illness\" in the psychological community,\\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\\n\\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\\njust e-mail me and I\\'ll send a summary file to you).  In the general\\npopulation, NT\\'s comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don\\'t know the exact percentage -\\nany help here a.p.p.er\\'s?)\\n\\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\\n\\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I\\'ve\\nknown many M.D.\\'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don\\'t oblige them\\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\\n\\nMaybe we need more NF doctor\\'s.  :^)\\n\\nEnough on this subject - let\\'s move on to candida bloom.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou\\'ve helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from \\'anal retentivitis\\', but being\\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\\nmyself in past posts.  Let\\'s all try to raise the level of this discussion\\nabove the level of anal effluent.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won\\'t get into the\\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT\\'s made this\\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\\ntherapy below).\\n\\n\\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\\nconsidered \\'systemic\\' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\\ninfection.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he\\'s one of those \\'evil\\' orthomolecular\\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\\n\\nHopefully, Elaine\\'s doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\\nall supplements.  I\\'m even reevaluating some supplements I\\'m taking, for\\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\\nnormal).\\n\\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can\\'t\\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950\\'s\\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\\ninflammation symptoms.  I\\'ll have to dig out that reference again since it\\nis relevant to this discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \\nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\\nirritation due to the body\\'s allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \\nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\\n\\nBTW, and I\\'ll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\\ndoesn\\'t cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He\\'s also found that\\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\\n\\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\\nlots of \\'ifs\\', and \\'implies\\', which doesn\\'t please the hard-core NT who\\nhas to have the double-blind study or it\\'s a non-issue, but one has to start\\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\\nand reject any and all aspects of the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' until the\\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can\\'t observe or culture\\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there\\'s no way to diagnose or\\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\\n\\nIt\\'s a real Catch-22.\\n\\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the \\'yeast hypothesis\\' say that\\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it\\'s not\\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I\\'m very aware of this for the\\nsmaller funded projects).  I\\'m afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice\\'s case histories and anecdotes\\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\\n\\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it\\'s a done issue - \\nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\\n\\n\\n\\nAren\\'t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\\nyou can\\'t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I\\'ve been in\\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It\\'s like trying to weed a garden\\nby cutting off what\\'s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\\nout again once you walk away.\\n\\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\\nis potentially lethal.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlso, if one is an \\'anal retentive\\', like I\\'ve been diagnosed in a prior\\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\\n\\n\\n\\nAs I\\'ve said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don\\'t work.\\nFor example, I went to three ENT\\'s, who all said that I will just have to live\\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab\\'s failed (they did mention\\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren\\'t plugged and it would not\\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\\nexperience of the three ENT\\'s I saw who said that I\\'d just have to \"live with\\nit\".  I\\'m confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\\nbecause of my overuse of ab\\'s for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\\n\\n\\n\\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\\nvisits to several ENT\\'s totally floored him when they said \"you\\'ll just have\\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\\npractice.  I\\'m sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\\n\"it\\'s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\\n\\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\\nthousand of his patients, shouldn\\'t you at least sit up and take notice?\\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\\ninstead of why it shouldn\\'t work.  I\\'m afraid a lot of doctors have become\\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\\nwe don\\'t see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\\nwent to a couple of doctor\\'s who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\\n\\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I\\'d like to hear a doctor tell me:\\n\"well, I\\'ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\\ncountry, and since they clearly don\\'t work for you, I now have the authority\\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\\ncan\\'t promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\\nthese unproven therapies, and I\\'ll have to register your case at the State\\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would\\'ve jumped on this\\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it\\'s doing everything\\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\\n(true quackery).\\n\\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper\\nworking of the mucos memebranes?\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrave soul you are.

It\\'s been on all weekend and it hardly\\neven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a \\nlot to do with it. \\n\\n   It\\'s up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I\\'ve also read about\\nsome people having problems with high speed serial communications. \\nI used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old\\ncomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then \"maps\" the other\\nmachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can \"cd\" to these\\ndrives and either run programs or copy files. It\\'s almost like a\\npeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.\\nIt\\'s not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this\\nmachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the \\npeer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive. \\n\\n  My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also\\nby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430\\ncredit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!\\n\\n  So, I\\'m glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I\\'m glad it\\nwas me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJohn\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\nAnd yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus\\nhimself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than\\nheaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new\\nchurches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev,\\nchapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word\\n\"throne\" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the\\nassignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are\\nalready judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no\\nrecourse, excuse or defense.\\n\\nYes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to\\nextremes before stopping at \"moderation.\"  I think we have seen the extreme of\\nthe \"hell fire & brimstone\" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme\\nwhere hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones\\nsensibilities.\\n\\nI forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a\\nstory.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the\\npoint of telling him that he didn\\'t believe in Satan or hell.  He believed\\neverybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to\\npray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man\\nwouldn\\'t do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don\\'t believe in\\nhell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn\\'t\\nexist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn\\'t\\nexist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And\\nyet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.\\n\\nI\\'d use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. \\nWhen I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that\\nisn\\'t called, oi vey!.  What\\'s with that ref that he didn\\'t make that call. \\nIt\\'s unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the\\nsurgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which\\nis still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness\\nwhich includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life,\\nthen broad is the way to distruction.\\n\\n\\nI think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all,\\nrepentance isn\\'t only a turning towards, but also a turning away from!\\nNo, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we\\nshould do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  \\n\\nI have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I\\nwould say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its\\neternality.\\n\\n1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness.\\n2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.\\n   If responsible, then he is also accountable.\\n3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God.\\n4) Christ.

There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content.

       " '[With Frank\\'s permission, I have added some information here (and in\\none case changed the order of his contributions) in order to clarify\\nthe historical relationship of the views.  My comments are based\\nprimarily on William Rusch\\'s historical summary in \"The Trinitarian\\nControversy\", Fortress.  I\\'m going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]\\n\\nMAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\\n \\n[SECOND CENTURY\\n\\nThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much\\nof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,\\nAthenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the\\n\"Apologists\".  Their theology has often been described as \"Logos\\ntheology\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less\\na two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the\\nFather, as his mind or thought.  This \"immanent Word\" became\\n\"expressed\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.\\nThus Jesus\\' full distinction from the Father only became visible in\\nhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.\\nRusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the\\nfinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,\\nbecause it did not have the technical language to properly deal with\\nthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.\\n\\nIrenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he\\nwas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as\\none personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible\\nexcept through his process of self-revelation (the \"economy\").  The\\ndistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized\\nthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus\\' views should\\nprobably be called \"economic trinitarianism\", though that term is\\nnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.\\n\\n\\nTHIRD CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nDynamic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Theodotus\\nAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature\\nand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are\\nconsubstantial with the Father\\'s divine essence only as impersonal attributes.\\nThe divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict\\nsense of the word.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable\\nimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The\\n\\'diversity\\' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the\\nwork of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to\\na hypostatic union.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and\\nwithout beginning or end.\\n Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in\\na unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.\\n Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality\\nis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.\\nCriticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation\\nconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the\\nHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical\\ndoctrine of salvation.\\n[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism\\nat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen\\nas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the\\nChurch.  --clh]\\n\\n \\nModalistic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Praxeas\\nAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals\\n(Jesus Only)\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is\\nqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This\\nessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\nThey are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The\\nthree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous\\nand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God\\'s modalistic manifesting\\nof himself. The paradox of a subsisting \"three in oneness\" is refuted by\\nrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different\\nnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of\\nthe only unique and unitary God\\n Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another\\nmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God\\nmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).\\n Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the\\none God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of\\nregeneration and sanctification.\\nCriticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian\\ndeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its\\nconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such\\nsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ\\'s baptism.\\n[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are\\nactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his\\nfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.\\nSabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic\\nTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,\\ninformation about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there\\nseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]\\n \\n[I\\'ve moved the following description to be with the other\\nthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]\\n\\n\"Economic\" Trinitarianism\\n \\nSource: Hippolytus, Tertullian\\nAdherents: Various \"neo-economic\" Trinitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,\\nSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,\\nindivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially\\ncomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated\\nby means of such terms as \"distinction\" and \"distribution\" dispelling\\neffectively the notion of separateness or division.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nThe equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in\\nobservation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the\\nGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this\\nambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.\\nCriticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the\\nrelational aspect of the Trinity.\\n[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as\\nmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in\\nthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they\\ndid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow\\npresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of\\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in\\nsubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially\\northodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]\\n\\n[Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted\\nto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms\\nof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a\\nmediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality\\nof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \"eternally\\ngenerated\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is\\neternal.  It cannot be said that \"there was once when he was not\" (a\\nphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son\\nis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described\\nas separate \"hypostases\", though this may not have quite the meaning\\nof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is\\none of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may\\nhave used the term homoousios (\"of the same substance\").  The Holy\\nSpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father\\nthrough the Son.  Origen\\'s intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but\\nhe pushes things in the direction of separateness.\\n\\n\\nFOURTH CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nSubordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]\\n \\nSource: Arius\\nMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, and several other lesser known\\ncults\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The inherent oneness of God\\'s nature is properly\\nidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet\\nentities who do not share the divine essence.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the\\nconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \"Threeness in oneness\" is self-\\ncontradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.\\n Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,\\nhe is not of the divine essence.\\n Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed\\nas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.\\nCriticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting\\nthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise\\nasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,\\nand the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.\\n[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully\\nhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.

As such, the Godhead exists \"undivided in\\ndivided persons.\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation\\nin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nIn its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,\\nand Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both\\nthe divine essence and function.\\nCriticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in\\nhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the\\nineffable mystery of \"three in oneness.\"\\n[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all\\nof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which\\nare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond\\nto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen\\'s thought a bit\\ntoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general\\nthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen\\'s, and it was hard\\nto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.

Unlike the conventional large \\nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \\nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \\nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \\nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \\nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \\ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \\nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \\nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \\nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \\nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \\ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \\nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \\nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \\nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \\nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \\nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \\nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \\nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \\nand results are discussed.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the\\n_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television\\nstation, KTVB Channel 7.\\n\\nRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.\\n\\nFriday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.\\n\\nSynopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent\\nCooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald\\nHowen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\\n\\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\\nthe government\\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\\nSpence attacked Cooper\\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\\nbetween Cooper\\'s statements last September and those made in court.\\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\\na few seconds...It\\'s difficult to remember what went on first.\"\\n\\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\\'s dog.\\n\\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\\'s\\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\\n\\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\\nhad Cooper discussed last August\\'s events, Cooper responded, \"If\\nyou\\'re implying that we got our story together, you\\'re wrong,\\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense\\'s version of\\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\\nkilling the Weaver\\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\\n\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\\'s\\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \\nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\\ndefense\\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I\\'m not going to play games with either\\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\\nacting like professionals.\"\\n\\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we\\'ll see\\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \\nSpence continued, \"We\\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\\n\\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\\'s repeated\\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can\\'t have a fair trial if the\\njury believes I\\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\\'m\\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\\'m\\nviolating court orders.\"\\n\\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\\'s\\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\\nhis comments when objecting.\\n\\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\\nRampton.  The prosecution\\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\\'s credibility.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\\' other attorney) questioned\\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\\nplans to kill the Weaver\\'s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"',\n",

Additional\\nreason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual\\nguidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA \"wishy-washy\".\\n \\nAs you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir-\\nregardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes\\nthe true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a\\ntraditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament\\nof PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth.\\nThe reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings\\nare not shared by everyone.\\n\\nI want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don\\'t want \\nthem attending a show.  It\\'s not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful\\nservice during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of\\nWorship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such\\nas the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it\\nis Not there.\\n\\nQuite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and \"fit in\".\\nMy dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils\\nwould intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who\\nhave beared with me this far understand what I mean.\\n\\nPlease keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not\\nto worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something\\nwrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or\\npastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn\\'t listen.  They are there to \\nprovide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with\\nthe Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change\\nfaiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and\\nministers.\\n\\nIn Christ,\\nKershner\\n-- \\nKershner Wyatt\\nkwyatt@ccscola.ColumbiaSC.ncr.com',\n",

A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks\\n  (similar to today\\'s checking system except entirely digital) may\\n  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and\\n  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an\\n  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum\\n  (~Dec.1992).\\n\\n  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus\\n  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the\\n  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to\\n  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:\\n\\n    ::\\n    command: help\\n    \\n    user@host\\n\\n  where `user@host\\' is your email address.\\n \\n  \\n_____\\n<5.2> What is a ``hacker\\'\\' or ``cracker\\'\\'?\\n\\n  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,\\n  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past\\n  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as\\n  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most\\n  internet users prefer the term ``cracker\\'\\' for this.  Instead, a\\n  ``hacker\\'\\' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,\\n  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a\\n  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and\\n  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also\\n  the ``Hacker\\'s Dictionary\\'\\' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq\\'.\\n \\n \\n_____\\n<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk\\'\\'?\\n\\n  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:\\n\\n  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were\\n  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy\\n  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,\\n  > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant\\n  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people\\n  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,\\n  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek\\n  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or\\n  > their opinions.\\n\\n  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.\\n\\n  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary\\n  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.\\n\\n_____\\n<5.4> What is `steganography\\' and anonymous pools?\\n\\n  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography\\' or the\\n  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication\\n  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. \\n  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the\\n  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible\\n  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,\\n  typically the most \\'noisy\\'. In addition, when such an item is\\n  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually\\n  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and\\n  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic\\n  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where\\n  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual\\n  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An\\n  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman\\n  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to\\n  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following\\n  commands in the subject line:\\n\\n    subscribe\\n    unsubscribe\\n    help\\n\\n_____\\n<5.5> What is `security through obscurity\\'?\\n\\n  `Security through obscurity\\' refers to the attempt to gain\\n  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information\\n  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make\\n  public information on its software\\'s encryption techniques to evade\\n  `attacks\\' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be\\n  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in\\n  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that\\n  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious\\n  because they are ``not widely known\\'\\' or ``not widely used.\\'\\' This\\n  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet\\n  posting `forgery\\'. `Security through obscurity\\' is regarded as a\\n  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at\\n  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach\\'\\'). See the FAQ\\n  for alt.security.  \\n  \\n  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic\\n  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First\\n  International Symposium on National Security & National\\n  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:\\n\\n  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep\\n  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It\\'s\\n  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If\\n  > something hits the Net and it\\'s something which people on there\\n  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I\\n  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into\\n  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting\\n  > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little\\n  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,\\n  > but you may differ...\\n\\n_____\\n<5.6> What are `identity daemons\\'?\\n  \\n  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to\\n  query a remote user\\'s login name after connection to a local\\n  communication socket (a connection of this type is established\\n  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).

The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,\\n  Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation\\n  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other\\n  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation\\n  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,\\n  NSA\\'s interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in\\n  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on\\n  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to\\n  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and\\n  caller identification.\\n\\n  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available\\n  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising\\n  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.

The movement reached a\\n  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal\\n  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of\\n  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.

       " \"Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a\\ncouple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\\nday timing cycle and so forth.\\n\\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\\noff ;-)\\n\\nThanks again everyone...\",\n",

Here's the box score followed by\\na few things I did pick up:\\n\\nFirst Period:\\n\\tHartford, Nylander 10, 8:51\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Recchi 53 (Lindros, Brind'Amour), 19:59.8 (pp)\\nPenalties - Verbeek, Har (holding), :55; Carkner, Phi (roughing), 13:53; Houda,\\nHar (interference) 18:43\\n\\nSecond Period:\\n\\tHartford, Burt 6 (Cunneyworth, Kron), 2:00\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Bowen 1 (Eklund, Recchi), 7:09\\n\\tHartford, Nylander 11 (Zalapski, Sanderson), 9:38\\nPenalties - Galley, Phi, major-game misconduct (spearing) :58; Verbeek, Har\\nmajor-game misconduct (spearing), :58; Brown, Phi (tripping), 3:22; Zalapski,\\nHar (tripping), 15:51; Brind'Amour, Phi (slashing), 19:50\\n\\nThird Period:\\n\\tHartford, Kron 14 (Sanderson, Cassels), 1:24 (pp)\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Beranek 15 (Lomakin, Yushkevich), 3:11\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Faust 2 (Brind'Amour, Roussel), 3:38\\nPenalties - Houda, Har (tripping), 4:20; Hawgood, Phi (holding), 5:30\\n\\nOvertime:\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Yushkevich 5 (Faust), 1:15.\\nPenalties - None\\n\\nPower Play:\\n\\tPhiladelphia 1 of 4, Hartford 1 of 4\\n\\nGoalies:\\n\\tPhiladelphia, Roussel 14-11-5 (30 shots - 26 saves)\\n\\tHartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)\\n\\nOn the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue\\nline and Nylander stripped him and took off.\\n\\nThe Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.\\n\\nThe Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it\\nended up behind the goalie.\\n\\nOn the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.\\nThis is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if\\nthey get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,\\nGalley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of\\nthem was the closest FLYER to the play.\\n\\nThat's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it\\nwas that scored, much less how.\\n\\nFrom what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart\\nasked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the\\ngame. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised\\nthat a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy \\nSoderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season\\nand, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.\\nBut here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for\\nnumber 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between\\nhim and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????\\n\\nWhat? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...\\n\\n#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.\\nThe difference between the team's record with him and without him is no\\naccident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without\\nRecchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric\\nLindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey\\nnext season.\\n\\n#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,\\nand Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't\\nplay a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family\\nhas a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy\\nSoderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again\\nabout being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.\\n\\n#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season\\nscoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player\\nget as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.\\nNot a tough choice.\\n\\nHonorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total\\nwhich he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line\\nthis year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the\\ndefensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.\\n\\nDimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie\\nmistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling\\nthat with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up\\nanything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman\\nin years to come.\\n\\nGarry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some\\nthings you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,\\nhe certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his\\nwishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive\\ncontribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end\\nwill make him a much more important part of the team next year.\\n\\nBrent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.\\nBut consistency became a problem for him.\\n\\nA couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members:\\n\\nTom Misnik, a member of the mailing list, would like to exchange E-mail\\naddresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer.\\nIf you're interested, you can send him mail at:\\n\\natt!ACR.ORG!TMISNIK\\n\\nThe FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning\\npercentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in\\nPatrick), 23-14-5 at home.

Shaz....\\n\\n[I\\'m not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.\\nThe primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style\\nof the translation.  It\\'s pretty unusual to see significant\\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\\ntext.  That\\'s because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don\\'t think there\\'s\\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don\\'t think there\\'s\\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\\nit has much practical effect.\\n\\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\\nthat don\\'t affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\\nall the versions.  I\\'m surprised to find a reference to this on the\\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I\\'ve been\\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions\\nthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from\\na variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine\\none of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all\\ninaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it\\'s not any edition\\nthat\\'s widely used.

I rather\\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley\\'s books!\\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\\nspeculation.

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \\nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \\neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \\nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \\nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \\nFellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact \\nSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology\\nManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or\\naddress below.  \\nALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO \\nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n#######################################################################\\n#################   New Program Announcement   ########################\\n#######################################################################\\n\\n\\n            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\\n\\nThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new\\nprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon \\nUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \\ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \\nJanuary 1994.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \\nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \\nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\\n\\n\\nPROGRAM DESIGN\\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \\ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \\nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\\n\\n\\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\\n\\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\\n\\nSTEVEN BRENER\\t\\t\\t\\tSUSIE BROWN\\nJSTMP\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\\t\\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\\t\\t\\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\\t\\t\\tFAX:\\t   (412) 268-8163\\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\\t\\t\\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\\t\\t\\n\\n############################################################################\\n############################################################################ \\n\\n\\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\\nmail.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

       " 'This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\\n==============================================================\\nHi Folks;\\n\\nWednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening\\nstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,\\neach side presenting its version of what happenned last August.\\n\\nThe prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to\\nIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \"evil\" federal\\ngovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal\\nagents \"sawed off\" shotguns and later failed to appear for\\ntrial: Despite repeated \"good faith\" efforts to get Weaver\\nto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted\\nwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and\\nbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three people\\nwere taking an \"offensive action\" against an FBI helicopter\\nwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.\\n\\nThe defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern\\nIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted\\nsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to\\nsell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution\\nalleged, want to become a \"regular supplier\").  The defense also\\nargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when\\nhe wouldn\\'t become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,\\nbut I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist\\nangle of the story.  We\\'ll know more as things develop].  The\\nfailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given\\nan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.\\nThe shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed\\nWeaver\\'s dog that was in proximity to Weaver\\'s son, Samuel.  Weaver\\nthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal\\nagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,\\nthere were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:\\nHowever, agents were near the body for an extended period of\\ntime and could have played with the select-fire - this will\\nhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims\\nthat Vicki Weaver was only going to \"look at the body\" [not recover?]\\nof her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.\\n\\nProsecution quote: \"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made\\nthat confrontation.\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist\\n\\nDefense quote: \"The evidence in this case is going to show that\\nthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged\\nwith crimes they didn\\'t commit in order to cover crimes that\\nthe government did commit.\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]\\n\\nNotes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters\\nheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday\\'s protests\\noutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate\\nagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including\\n\"Tim\" again.  \"Tim\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \"ordinary,\\nworking class people.\"  He also claimed he was for \"white pride,\\nnot white power.\"\\n\\nOutside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview\\nwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly\\nwhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.\\n\\nIn an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about\\na dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the\\ncourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence\\nin action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some\\ntidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent\\nwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they\\nbelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,\\nrepeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the\\ndefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the\\nrecounting of his wife\\'s death), and Spence compared the \"sawed\\noff\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another\\ngood one!).\\n\\nToday (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to\\nbegin presenting evidence.\\n\\nDrew\\n=============================================================\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Michael Bushnell writes;\\n\\n\\nWhich is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use\\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\\n\\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\\nCreed (it wasn\\'t there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\\n\\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\\nbelow)\\n\\n\\t\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\\nthrough the Son\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\\na more preeminent way.\\n\\n\\t\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\\n\\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\\n\\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\\nmention of the Son being necessary.\\n\\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\\nposition, which I enunciated above.\\n\\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\\n\\n\\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\\nfrom it.\"\\n\\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him\\'; and again it\\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\\nis none of His.\\'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,\\' and that `He shall\\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.\\'\"\\n\\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\\nFather,\\' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,\\' and `will\\nreceive of mine,\\' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\\n\\t\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\\nis the Spirit created.\"\\n\\t-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\\nit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,\\nit is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to\\nspeak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the\\nSon, His Sources.\"\\n\\t-St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)\\n\\n\\tThus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt,\\nPalastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time,\\nall have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine\\nexpressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church\\nthat they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus\\nwho all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is\\nnot enough to bring up the \"proceeds from the Father\" line of the Creed\\nor the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does\\nnot say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does\\nproceed from the Father.',\n",

At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos\\nthe military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from\\nthe missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially\\nafter the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It\\nseemed to me that they didn\\'t have the stomach for the reality of war,\\nthat innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It\\'s like\\nthey were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \"nice and clean\" (smart\\nmissiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,\\ndying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!\\n\\n\\n[ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]\\n                            ^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nI should have said here \"militarily justified\".  It seems from your\\ncomments below that you understood this as meaning \"morally justified\".\\nI apologize.\\n\\n\\nI have often wondered about this.  I\\'ve always thought that the first bomb\\nshould have been dropped on Japan\\'s island fortress of Truk.  A good,\\ninpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could\\'ve been held back\\nfor use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.\\n\\nYes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan\\nwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,\\nthe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US\\'s\\nulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made\\nwhich affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the \\ncircumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the\\nsuffering caused by those decisions.  \\n\\n[...]\\n\\n\\nActually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US\\nand allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other\\nback-water country, we probably wouldn\\'t intervene.  Not that we don\\'t\\ncare, but we can\\'t be the world\\'s policman.  Or if a coup had occured\\nin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn\\'t have acted\\nbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to\\nSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion\\nby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West\\'s oil \\ninterests, caused us to take action.\\n\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nI\\'m not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the\\nwar, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep\\nKuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.\\n\\nWell, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler\\nwould lead their nation to.\\n\\n\\nThey suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?\\nThe world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many\\ninnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,\\nbut that\\'s The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nProbably because we\\'re not the saviors of the world.  We can\\'t police each\\nand every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor\\nare we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or\\nsome other places.\\n\\nTell me how we could stop them and I\\'ll support it.  I, for one, do not\\nagree with the present US policy of \"sucking up to them\" as you put it.\\nI agree that it is deplorable.\\n\\n\\nAre they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale\\nwhere the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed\\nunless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue\\nis in order.)  I\\'m not an expert on California law, or even US law, but\\nit seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize\\nthe system, but let\\'s not have unfounded allegations of racial \\nprejudice thrown around.\\n\\n\\nNo, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks\\non the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.\\n\\n\\nGermans, perhaps.  \"Peers\" doesn\\'t mean \"those who do the same thing\",\\nlike having murderers judge murderers.  It means \"having people from\\nthe same station in life\", presumably because they are in a better\\nposition to understand the defendent\\'s motivation(s).\\n\\n\\nOK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*\\nlogical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.\\n\\nThe media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing\\nliberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give\\na balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative\\nsources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)\\n\\nBTW, I never used the word \"conspiracy\".  I don\\'t accept (without *far*\\nmore evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal\\nconspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.\\n\\n\\nHardly.  I didn\\'t say that it\\'s a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people\\nif the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don\\'t live in a perfect world and\\nthere are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then\\ninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn\\'t say\\nit is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.\\n\\n\\nI would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain\\nand suffering.  I\\'m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let\\'s say) we now know.  That doesn\\'t\\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn\\'t see it as\\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\\n\\nBut don\\'t assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\\ndon\\'t!  I just don\\'t condemn those who had to make a difficult\\ndecision under difficult circumstances.\\n\\n\\nYou certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.\\nI, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.\\n\\n\\nWrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to\\nthose making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply\\nrefuse to condemn them for their decision.\\n\\nOne day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action;\\neven this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of\\nthat, and I am prepared to do so.  I don\\'t believe that you can make the\\nsame claim.\\n\\n\\nAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was\\nbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being \\n\"so deplorable\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\\nwasn\\'t accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \\nwe are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of \\n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \\nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \\nWhat hogwash.

This\\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\\nmake sure they stop''.\\n\\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.

There is one\\nsmall error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.\\n\\n\\nOf course, the one thing to note is that in the Canada/France/Germany\\ncase, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public\\nsector.  They realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra\\ninsurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward\\naccomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal\\nbenefits, they\\'ll have nothing to do with you if you want to be\\ncovered for basic care.\\n\\nAt that point, they wouldn\\'t even consider a \"voucher\" approach\\nto broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up\\nthe difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.\\n\\n\\nIt is \"free\" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two\\nthings which I advocate to make the Canadian insurance look more like\\nreal health insurance -- which actually it is).  I know that when\\nworking in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec, I was aware that I was paying\\nfor health insurance - e.g., in Toronto, OHIP fees were listed on my\\npay stub; Manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only\\nannually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  Only fiscal\\nnaifs will proclaim that it\\'s free, along with the Canadian Left for\\nthat is part of their brainwashing agenda.\\n\\nThe French do have copayments, though.  France Magazine\\'s Summer \\n1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance\\ncoverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For \\n1-30 days, you\\'re covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%\\nafterward.  With extra private insurance, you can get into a private\\nhospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital\\nrate.  The public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same\\ncash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid\\nout-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.\\nOver 2/3rds of French have some form of extra private insurance.  So,\\nthe other 30% of health costs in Europe are out of private funds, not\\ngleaned from other taxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and\\nprivate expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that\\nyield the 13-14% figure for the U.S.\\n\\n\\nHealth insurance does exist in Canada and in Western Europe, its\\njust that it doesn\\'t cover basic care.  You can opt out in Canada\\nand Germany, but you\\'ll have to go uninsured as a result because\\nthere are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.\\n\\nWhen private insurance realized how much money they\\'d make without the\\nrisks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe\\namenities (e.g., having to call Granada TV to replace a rental set on\\nthe fritz in someone\\'s private hospital room), they started to pat\\nthemselves on the back for their social responsibility.

When he included that bit\\nfrom Merlinus X\\' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes\\nto which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.\\nI have little knowledge regarding Reuss\\' background, but surely\\nhe was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order \\nfor many years.\\n\\nYet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back\\nso carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is\\nonly the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed\\nwhich extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there\\nwas and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order\\nitself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.\\n\\n\\nLet us examine this issue a bit more closely....\\n\\n\"In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist\\nand paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo\\nTempli Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he\\nmet three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  \\nKellner\\'s efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz\\nHartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together\\nprior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902\\nin Reuss\\'s Masonic publication, \\'Oriflamme\\'.  On Kellner\\'s death,\\nReuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The \\'Jubilee\\' edition of\\nthe \\'Oriflamme\\', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught\\nsecret of sexual magic.\\n \\n\"Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in\\nAugsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and\\npossibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist\\nLeague founded by Karl Marx\\'s daughter and her husband.  Reuss was\\nlater associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden\\nDawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to\\nfound the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several\\nattempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the\\ndevelopment of the O.T.O.\\n\\n\"The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss\\' leadership.\\nFor example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin\\nand H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between\\nReuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and\\naccused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,\\nthe initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for\\nthe first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all\\nthe English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked\\nwhen publishing the material of the Equinox.\\n\\n\"Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a\\nstroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when\\n_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break\\nin the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.\\nover the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.\\nHe had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss\\'s request, deeply\\ninfusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.\"\\n\\n_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX\\'\\n\\nWithin _Equinox III:10_, Edited by \\n  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,\\n    Caliph of the United States of America,\\n      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this\\nmaterial in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?\\nWhy did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own\\norganization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle\\nof Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very\\ncomplex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room\\nfor very many interpretations.\\n\\nIt is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived\\nout of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters\\nwith an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I\\ncan take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble\\nsupport of the \\'Law of Thelema\\' is laughable at best.\\n\\nWould I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  \\nWill I?  \\nI think not.\\nWhy?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection\\nI am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things\\nin the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be\\nquite difficult to apprehend at first.\\n\\nSo it may be with OTO and Merlinus X\\'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.\\nI do not support Reuss\\'s words myself, as I am not qualified to assess\\nthem, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of\\nthe Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then\\nwhat can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that\\nthe Order has \\'gone soft\\' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or\\ndoes it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of\\nuniversal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic\\nrequirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?\\n\\n\\nI find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.\\nThey are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane\\nor usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  \\nHaving met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or\\nwere very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity\\nof the organization as it stands.\\n\\nI have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments \\nI followed my intuition, and I\\'ve found little to stop me from requesting\\na Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I\\'m happily participating\\nin social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic\\nMass well enough for my tastes.\\n \\n\\nThis doesn\\'t make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.\\nI can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my\\nlimited contact with other members.\\n\\nI urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many\\nways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with\\nthe Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom\\nand the preservation of individual vision.\\n\\nI welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response\\nto other posts in this thread.\\n\\n\\nInvoke me under my stars.

       " 'I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.\\nSteve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. \\nMed. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \\nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \\nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \\nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \\n\\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \\nno idea how the human body interacts with it\\'s environment and how that \\nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \\nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \\nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \\nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \\nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn\\'t help Elaine or Jon\\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \\nquack.  \\n\\nI\\'ve been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \\nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \\nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \\nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \\nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \\nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \\neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That\\'s okay because I \\nknow that some of what I\\'m teaching is going to stick and there will be at \\nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It\\'s really \\ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don\\'t cover nutrition because if \\nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \\nmedical profession.\\n\\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \\nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \\nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \\nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \\nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \\nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \\nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \\nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \\nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \\ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \\nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \\nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \\nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\\nSteve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\nElaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \\nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \\nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \\n\\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \\nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \\ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \\nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \\nit\\'s food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \\nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \\nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \\nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\nthe candida or not isn\\'t certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \\nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\\nIf it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\nnondiscript.  \\n\\n\\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \\nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \\nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \\nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \\npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \\ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it\\'s name, it is an acid loving \\norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \\ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \\nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \\nantibiotics).  \\n\\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \\ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \\nduring a woman\\'s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \\nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \\nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \\nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \\nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \\nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \\nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \\nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \\nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \\ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \\nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \\nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \\nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \\nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \\naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \\nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \\nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \\nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \\nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \\ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\\n \\nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \\nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \\nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \\nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \\nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \\nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \\nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \\nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \\nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it\\'s not going to out \\ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \\nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \\nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\\n\\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \\nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \\naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor\\'s use of vitamin \\nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.

On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal\\ncarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I\\nfelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat\\nthat \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent\\nthe following to the WSJ.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nGun Stats & Mortal Risks\\n\\nPreston K. Covey\\n\\n\\n\\tErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \\n \\n\\tResponsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \\nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\\nhere. \\n\\n\\tThe NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\\ntake the bus?  \\n\\n\\tUncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\\n\\n\\tThe ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\\nhomes unaccounted.\\n\\n\\tThe NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\\nsix counts:\\n\\n\\t1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\\ncriminological hogwash.\\n\\n\\t2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\\ncrucially affect the risk. \\n\\n\\t3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \\nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\\nthe matter.\\n\\n\\t4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\\ndisregard this issue.\\n\\n\\t5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \\nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \\n\\n\\t6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\\n\\tKleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \\n\\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \\n\\n\\tOf course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \\nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.\\n',\n",

They still arm themselves to \"defend the\\n#>faith\", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a\\n#>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives\\n#>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their\\n#>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.\\n#                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy \"they,\" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when\\nJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \"accusations\" were filed, most of\\nwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.\\nI have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove\\nthat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \"illegal activities.\"\\nPlural marriage, yes, but your charge of \"underage\" wives sounds like it\\ncould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral\\nstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it\\nappears, those of David Koresh.\\n\\n#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram\\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make\\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  The\\n\\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'s\\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\\n\\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help\\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\\n\\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the senior\\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\\n\\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\\n\\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\\n\\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\\n#\\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\\n\\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn\\'t \"splinter\"\\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\\n\\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They\\'re pledged to defend\\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually\\n#>do - even to the point of suicide.)\\n\\nWhat a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am\\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\\nsuicide and \"atone for sins with blood\") is yet another insulting\\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\\n\\n#\\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have\\n#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I\\'m taking it with a salt block.\\n\\nMake it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.\\n\\n#>  So he hired virtually no one but\\n#>Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the\\n#>Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI\\n#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.\\n#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI\\'s treatment\\n#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.\\n\\nPreposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\\nof honor and conduct (that\\'s why they were selected for in the\\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\\n\\n#        If it\\'s true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\\n#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more\\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\\n\\nA good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people\\nare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon\\'s \"orders\" (the late\\npresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong\\nopposition of the selection of the MX \"Peace Keeper\" missile maze\\nin Utah).\\n\\n#        That\\'s my somewhat educated guess, anyway.

The founder of this\\nsect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the\\nPromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major\\nreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-\\nduism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of\\nJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised\\nMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all\\nthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger\\nfrom God have been fulfilled.\\n\\n        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and\\nextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-\\ntians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-\\nnessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect\\nis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.\\nDispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many\\nadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who\\ncome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.\\n\\n        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about\\na better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-\\ngions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-\\nerhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi\\nMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-\\ncially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.\\n\\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\\ntablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-\\nics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed\\nby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect\\'s\\ninternal resources.\\n\\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\\nreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\\none universal religion.\\n\\n\\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \\n==================',\n",

       " 'The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for\\nsome time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a\\nsymbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that\\nthe _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar,\\nRelics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real,\\nalmost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real\\nsacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all\\nto be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking\\nprecludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it\\nsimply IS holy.\\n\\nBut, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if\\nwell- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely\\nto see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which\\ncould be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the\\nmass has become a commercial for God\\'s grace rather than the real\\nthing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn\\'t\\ndare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have\\nbeen encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing\\non _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in\\nliturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or\\nthe heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic\\nexample of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of\\nthe sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita\\nbread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered\\nin particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but\\nCatholics in the past would have been distraught at this real\\ndesacration of the real symbol of Jesus\\' body.\\n\\nModern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We\\ntry to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac\\npriest get up and \\'explain\\' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and\\nstart pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience.\\nIt doesn\\'t help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and\\nthree chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated\\ntunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the\\ngenius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize\\' is only\\nslightly better.\\n\\nWhat are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it\\ndoesn\\'t work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well\\nprepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW\\na matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is\\nthe attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative\\nliturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean\\nthe Church will be socially conservative.\\n\\nIn NYC I can recommend:\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St.\\n\\tCorpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, \\n\\tSt. Joseph\\'s, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, \"clean\", largely gay\\n\\tOratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful\\n\\nAvoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.\\n\\nHappy Easter: Christos Aneste\\', Christos Voskrezhne, Christ is Risen',\n",

Sophisticated\\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\\ninnovative approaches.\\n\\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\\n\\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\\n\\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\\n\\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\\nescrow system.\\n\\nKEY-ESCROW\\n\\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\\ncommunications.\\n\\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\\n\\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.

After all, laws in made by representatives of the \\n<people.  These representatives of the people have already decided\\n<that the Second Amendment does not apply or is too broad in some\\n<cases.  Since these representatives feel an unconditional \\n<interpretation is not wanted, then it is probable that they majority\\n<of the people feel the same way.  If this is so, it is an example\\n<of the people using their power of government.  If this is not\\n<how the people feel, the people should stand up and state their wishes.\\n\\nWrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the\\npeople almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are\\nthere to prevent a \\'tyrrany of the majority\\'.  For example, a majority\\ncould vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.\\nand it would fly using the logic above.\\n\\nWhen government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,\\nthere is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis\\nis deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those\\nwho decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a\\nmajority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting\\nthe hangee.\\n\\nWhat the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the\\nlimitations on the government, probably because they know that the\\npeople would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind\\ntampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has\\nbeen very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just\\nshows how gullible the people have become to \"I am from the government\\nand am here to help you sort of line\".  We have been lied to, fed\\nhalf truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control\\nlaws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on\\nforce, pure and simple.

It is not necessary to celebrate a pagan\\ngoddess in the process.\\n\\nPaul answered your question in Romans 9.  In v. 4 he stated that the\\nadoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of\\nGod, and the promises were given to the Israelites.  It is a package deal.\\n He goes on to identify those who are true Israelites.  Vs 6-8 makes it\\nplain that the true Israelites are not those who are born that way but\\nthose who accept the promise of God.  Paul continued to emphasize that he\\nwas an Israelite in 2 Cor. 11:22, then in Gal 3:29 he says that all those\\nwho belong to Christ are Abraham\\'s seed, and heirs to all the promises\\ngiven to the Israelites.

       " 'As our local.religion.christian BBS group seems moribund, I\\'m posting here.\\n\\nOn one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was\\nbased on a story in the Book of Joshua.

After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On\\nthe other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values\\nheld by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in\\nout-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual\\nwarfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.\\n\\nThe next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites\\ntake Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except\\nfor Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about\\nBosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that\\nthe massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered\\nme was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I\\nshouldn\\'t be so troubled about the reports of \"ethnic cleansing\" in\\nBosnia.

The most recent expansion \\ndrafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction \\nbetween forwards and defensemen.\\n        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down \\nfrom the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and \\nOttawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.\\n        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of \\none goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is \\nthat a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.\\n        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises \\nwill have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total \\nof 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa \\nBay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two \\nnew teams.\\n        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority \\ndrafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst \\nrecords. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The \\nexpansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, \\nTampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.\\n        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry \\nDraft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new \\nteams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in \\n1994.\\n\\n        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the \\n1995 draft in Winnipeg.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \\nMontreal).

It is \\na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\\n \\n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \\nthe NHL?\\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \\nchances.\\n \\n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \\na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \\n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\\n \\n Q: What is the five-hole?\\n A: The space between a goalie\\'s pads. There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \\ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\\n\\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \\nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \\nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \\nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \\nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \\nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \\nlost the game, 6-4.\\n\\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \\nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \\nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \\nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\\n\\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \\nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \\nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as \\nassistant general counsel. He became the league\\'s chief legal officer in \\nSeptember of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \\nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\\n\\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \\nColonial Hockey Leagues.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\n9.

       " 'Dean Velasco quoted a letter from James M Stowell, president of\\nMoody Bible Institute:\\n\\n\\n\\nThere has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on\\nexactly what the criticism of \"arrogance\" is aimed at.\\n\\nThe arrogance being attacked is that we \"think we are the only ones who know\\nwhat the absolutes are\".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\\n\\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\\na very troubling one.\\n\\nThe problem with `absolute certainty\\' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\\n\\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\\n\\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\\nTruth.\\n\\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\\n\\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\\n\\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\\n\\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\\n\\n\\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let\\'s go back to our shorthand method of doing\\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\\n\\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\\n\\n B: How do you know?\\n\\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\\n\\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\\n\\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\\n\\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn\\'t mean it is\\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\\n\\n A: ...\\n\\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \"I\\ncan\\'t prove that there are no mistakes\" -- and as long as you may have made a\\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\\n\\nThere is no way out of the loop.\\n\\n\\nThis is where the \"arrogance of Christians\" arises: many people believe\\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\\n\\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\\n\\n *\\n\\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking\\nthe idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well),\\nbut the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is\\nknowably Inerrant.\\n',\n",

Working off 1 IRQ and 1 DMA channel on an ISA (or whatever) bus?\\n\\n\\nA friend of mine just got a Maxtor 245 meg IDE drive for $320.  (that's 245\\nmillion bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  With the basic $20 interface, he gets\\nclose to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  Does your figure include a few\\nhundred $$$ for SCSI drivers?\\n\\n\\nSo you're saying that SCSI would have been the default interface type,\\nconsidering that the vast majority of PC's don't have cd-rom drives or\\ntape backups or etc?  That most PC's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and\\nrun DOS?  That SCSI hard drives cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drives\\nat the time?  (and how common were SCSI drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years\\nago?)  There's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that\\nprevented SCSI from becoming the connection medium of choice.\\n\\n\\nBut on that point, is it faster?  This is what all this is about.  Do you\\nget more performance for the money.  For all the people that will only have\\na single hard drive in their system (regardless of the OS) will the SCSI\\nchoice really give them more performance than IDE?\\n\\n\\nTrue, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option\\nis there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.\\n\\n\\nNo argument.  This is always held up to the first time SCSI buyer as the\\nbest reason.  But how many SCSI devices will the first time SCSI buyer\\neventually acquire?  Again does it make sense to go SCSI for a single\\nhard drive system?\\n\\n\\nWith all the postings on the SCSI I or II specs, are you really sure that\\nPC and Apple SCSI hard drives are compatible?  And even if they are, \\nis the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/\\npartitioning or file table differences?)  Is it really plug'n'play?\\n\\n\\nSo the C: drive on the connor becomes a logical D: drive to DOS.  Is this\\nreally a problem?  \\n\\n\\nAfter having two IDE drives in my system for temporary file transfers,\\nI have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor\\nhave I ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or\\nto/from the same drive.\\n\\n\\nThat is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  I do believe that\\nthere is the possibility for up to 4 IDE drives on a PC.\\n\",\n",

       " 'This is the official Request for Discussion (RFD) for the creation of two\\nnew newsgroups for Microsoft Windows NT.  This is a second RFD, replacing\\nthe one originally posted in January \\'93 (and never taken to a vote).  The\\nproposed groups are described below:\\n\\nNAME: \\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.setup\\nSTATUS:  Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Discussions about setting up and installing Windows NT, and about\\n\\t system and peripheral compatability issues for Windows NT.\\n\\nNAME:\\t comp.os.ms-windows.nt.misc\\nSTATUS:\\t Unmoderated.\\nPURPOSE: Miscellaneous non-programming discussions about using Windows NT,\\n\\t including issues such as security, networking features, console\\n\\t mode and Windows 3.1 (Win16) compatability.\\n\\nRATIONALE:\\n\\tMicrosoft NT is the newest member of the Microsoft Windows family\\n\\tof operating systems (or operating environments for those who wish\\n\\tto argue about the meaning of an \"OS\").  The family ranges from\\n\\tModular Windows through Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups to\\n\\tWindows NT at the high end.  To date, Microsoft has shipped over\\n\\t50,000 beta copies and pre-release SDKs of Windows NT -- the\\n\\tactual release is slated for May/June \\'93.\\n\\n\\tWhile Windows NT has an entirely new design internally, it shares\\n\\tan application programming interface with the other members of the\\n\\tWindows family; its Win32 API includes the Win16 API used in Win-\\n\\tdows 3.1, and the Win32s API subset (Win32 less threads, networking\\n\\tand security) can be used to create 32-bit applications for\\n\\tWindows 3.1.\\n\\n\\tThe user interface is also practically identical to that of Windows\\n\\t3.1, with the addition of logins and a few other features.  It uses\\n\\tProgram Manager, File Manager and other applets, and generally pre-\\n\\tsents an identical appearance to the user.  Many of the announced\\n\\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\\n\\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\\n\\n\\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\\n\\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\\n\\t\\n\\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\\n\\twell as Windows 3.1:\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\\n\\t\\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\\n\\t\\n\\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\\n\\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\\n\\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\\n\\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\\n\\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\\n\\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\\n\\n\\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\\n\\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\\n\\tgeneration Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it should\\n\\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\\n\\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION PERIOD:\\n\\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \\n\\nVOTING:\\n\\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\\n\\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.

Hardin\\n\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\\n#1506\\n\\n     Scientists at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth\\'s ozone layer.\\n\\n     The April 3 flight from California\\'s Barstow/Daggett Airport\\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \\n\\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\\nDiscovery.\\n\\n     \"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\\n\\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\\'s Upper\\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\\nProgram.

How do I make a screendump or print my application?\\n\\n\\tThe xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window \\nor the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. \\nThe file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr \\nclient and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:\\n\\t\\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &\\nand then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current\\ndisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an\\nundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the \\ncommand-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for \\nspecifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]\\n\\n\\tTwo publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of \\narbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.\\nThere are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]\\nis the most recent.\\n\\txsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders \\nXPM output [version unknown].

Also on several archives are xwd2ps\\nand XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for \\nuse in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and\\ncontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive\\nservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.\\n\\n\\tThe XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and\\nsave it in one of the available formats.

It includes support for many types of bitmaps, \\ngray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;\\nthe most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\\n\\tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center\\'s IMtools (\\'imconv\\' in \\nparticular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.\\nIt\\'s available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\\n\\n\\tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost\\'s xloadimage, a\\nversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are \\nlater versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  \\nGraeme Gill\\'s updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; \\nsee xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\\n\\n\\txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), \\ncan read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, \\nGIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, \\ncontrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned \\nformats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on \\nit, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; \\nsee the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.\\n\\n\\tThe Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.\\nConversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available\\nvia FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, \\nand ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.\\n\\n\\tThe Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads\\nand writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image\\nmanipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as\\ncontrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.\\n\\n\\tThe Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar \\nto PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, \\nweedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.\\n\\n\\tXim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential \\ninteractive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is \\na version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and \\nMotif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, \\nxwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a\\nlibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.\\n\\n\\tImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from \\nexport\\'s contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display\\nimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF\\nfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.\\n\\n\\txtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written\\nto handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining\\nsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems\\nwith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed\\nas part of Sam Leffler\\'s libtiff package and it is also available on\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x.

[1/93]\\n\\nOther good sources of information include the R4 version of that document\\nand also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a \\ncompilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 \\nsequences.

If you give \\na resource specification like this:\\n\\t\\txterm*geometry: 80x24\\nthen you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to\\n80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. \\nBut its popup menus don\\'t; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only\\nthe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:\\n\\t\\txterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?\\n\\n\\tYou could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. \\nHowever, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for \\nmanipulating the selection will help; e.g. \\n\\t% xselection PRIMARY | lpr\\nfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a \\nwindow-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of\\nthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\\n\\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\\nadapted to do this.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\\n\\n\\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are \\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \\nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \\napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\n\\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open Windows, and you also \\nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \\nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \\napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \\nXtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\\n                application\\'s class name.\\n        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n                literal string \"app-defaults\"\\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\\n        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\\n        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\\n        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\\n        %t      The territory part of the display\\'s language string\\n        %c      The codeset part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\\'s class name is \\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \\nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\n\\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \\nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \\nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\n\\tLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set \\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \\ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n\\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \\nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \\nMyterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so you can run the application\\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\\n%S are useless.\\n\\n\\tWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization \\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\n\\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character \\ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\n\\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n\\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\\nthis batch of default settings.)\\n\\n\\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n\\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory \\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \\nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\n\\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \\nto \".\", a single dot.

(You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \\nthe path.)\\n\\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\\n\\t\\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\\n\\t\\t\\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\\n\\t\\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\\n\\n\\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\\nmention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)\\n\\n-- Is the font directory you\\'re specifying readable from the SERVER\\'s file\\n   system?  Remember, it\\'s the server, not the client, which interprets your\\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and\\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\\n\\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you\\'re running an MIT server\\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\\n   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can\\'t find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you\\'re\\n   running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".

       " \"[...]\\nhenrik]  Country. Turks and Azeris consistantly WANT to drag ARMENIA into the\\nhenrik]  KARABAKH conflict with Azerbaijan. \\n\\nBM] Gimme a break.  CAPITAL letters, or NOT, the above is pure nonsense.  It\\nBM] seems to me that short sighted Armenians are escalating the hostilities\\n\\t\\t\\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nhenrik]\\tAgain, Armenians in KARABAKH are SIMPLY defending themselves. What do\\nhenrik]\\twant them to do. Lay down their ARMS and let Azeris walk all over them.\\n\\nNews reports I've seen say otherwise both location and motives wise.  \\nCAPS don't change facts.\\n\\nBM] while hoping that Turkey will stay out.  Stop and think for a moment,\\nBM] will you?  Armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it\\nBM] is a part of it.  \\n\\nhenrik]   Armenians KNEW from the begining that TURKS were FULLY engaged \\nhenrik]   training AZERIS militarily to fight against  KARABAKHI-Armenians.\\n\\nSo?  Should I, at this point break into caps and start talking about \\nDEFENSE etc.?  I don't know how 'fully engaged' Turkey is/was though.\\n\\nhenrik] The KARABAKHI-ARMENIANS who have lived in their HOMELAND for 3000 \\nhenrik] years (CUT OFF FROM ARMENIA and GIVEN TO AZERIS BY STALIN) are the \\nhenrik] ones DIRECTLY involved in the CONFLICT. They are defending \\nhenrik] themselves against AZERI AGGRESSION. \\n\\nBM] Huh?  You didn't expect Azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them\\nBM]  within their borders?  \\n\\nhenrik] Well, history is SAD. Remember, those are relocated Azeris into \\nhenrik] the Armenian LAND of KARABAKH by the STALIN regime.\\n\\nSo I hear.  This justifies bloodshed N years after the fact?\\n\\nhenrik] At last, I hope that the U.S. insists that Turkey stay out of the \\nhenrik] KARABAKH crisis so that the repeat of the CYPRUS invasion WILL NEVER \\nhenrik] OCCUR again.\\n\\nBM] You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade?\\n\\nhenrik] It is not up to me to speculate but I am sure Turkey would have stepped\\nhenrik] into Armenia if SHE could.\\n\\nWhy would Turkey do that?  Do you not realize that this is a local clash\\nthat Turkey never wished to see happen?  Turkey has other plans for region,\\nlike economic revival, co-operation etc.  Good stuff in other words,  I'd\\nbe happy to bicker with Armenians over trade barriers and such on USENET\\nrather than 'who killed whom in what way' which I detest doing and wouldn't \\ndo.  \\n\\nBM] Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header\\nBM] in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Absolutely NOT ! I am merely trying to emphasize that in many\\nhenrik]\\t   cases, HISTORY repeats itself. \\n\\nEven if one buys into your implicit premise, the sane thing to do would\\nbe to try not to provoke Turkey as was done in '74.  If there'd been\\na democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in Athens at the\\ntime, everybody would have stayed home with their families.  [I have no\\nwish to go into the Cyprus quarrel, but I suspect what I've said is not\\nonly accurate but also palatable to all parties involved]\\n\\nBM] Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes \\nBM] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring\\nBM] the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians \\nBM] are attacking Azeri towns.\\n\\nhenrik]\\t   So, let me understand in plain WORDS what you are saying; Turkey\\nhenrik]\\t   wants a PEACEFUL END to this CONFLICT. NOT !!\\n\\nSo what do you think we want?  War, death and destruction?  \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   I will believe it when I see it.\\n\\nNo, if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it.\\n\\nhenrik]  Now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a GUN pointing\\nhenrik]to your HEAD ? Do you sit there and WATCH or DEFEND yoursef(fat chance)?\\n\\t\\nThis kind of childish rhetoric doesn't help anthing.\\n\\nhenrik]  Do you remember what Azeris did to the Armenians in BAKU ? All the\\nhenrik]  BARBERIAN ACTS especially against MOTHERS and their CHILDREN. I mean\\nhenrik]  BURNING people ALIVE !\\n\\nNow, some Azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff\\nperpetrated by Armenians.  One should re-hash stuff like this often to\\nkeep the hatred alive, right?\\n\\nBM] Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the \\nBM]futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that \\nBM] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's \\nBM] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Armenians in KARABAKH want PEACE and their own republic. They are \\nhenrik]\\t   NOT asking much. They simply want to get back what was TAKEN AWAY \\nhenrik]\\t   from them and GIVEN to AZERIS by STALIN. \\n\\nWell they obviously aren't getting anywhere with their current methods\\nof asking (not very peaceful I'd say).\\n\\nBM] Think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent \\nBM] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe \\nBM] the other out.   These people will be neighbors, would it not be better \\nBM] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?\\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Don't get me WRONG. I also want PEACEFUL solution to the\\nhenrik]\\t   conflict. But until Azeris realize that, the Armenians in\\nhenrik]\\t   KARABAKH will defend themselves against aggresion.\\n\\nI don't know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans.\\nPeace isn't what's happening right now, furthermore what's happening\\nright now isn't condusive to peace.  You can spend days and nights \\nraving about how 'right' the Armenian position is and I'm sure\\nthere'll be others who'd be happy to talk to you by arguing the other\\nside.  If entrenched positions lead to war, and if people want peace\\nthan they should sit down and talk about a compromise.  Armenia isn't\\nstrong enough to exercise the 'we think we're right, and we have the \\nbombs, so we'll do whatever we want, so there...' style of foreign \\nrelations.  Yes you can type Stalin in caps, and give one sided\\natrocity stories etc. but for peace you need to be willing to talk to \\nthe other side.  You personally can choose not to do that of course,\\nthis being just USENET.  The people in power shouldn't be so childish.\\n\\n\\nBM] If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes\\nBM] your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of \\nBM] their blood and future. \\n\\nhenrik]\\t   Again, you are taking different TURNS. Armenia HAS no intension\\nhenrik]\\t   to GRAB any LAND from Azerbaijan. The Armenians in KARABAKH\\nhenrik]\\t   are simply defending themselves UNTIL a solution is SET.\\n\\nAzeri's would disagree with you on this, and the maps I've seen support\\nwhat they'd be saying.  It doesn't seem likely that a solution will be\\nreached in this manner.  \\n\\nBM] It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize \\nBM] craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians\\nBM] in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate \\nBM] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in\\nBM] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  I'd push for\\nBM] compromise if I were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading\\nBM] inflammatory half-truths.\\n\\nhenrik]   It is NOT up to me to decide the PEACE initiative. I am absolutely\\nhenrik]   for it. \\n\\nIt didn't look it when I read your posting.  It would seem to me \\nthat if you can spew mis-information about a boogey-man, you can also\\ntalk about how one might avoid the nastiness.  Fair?\\n\\nhenrik] But, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself,\\nhenrik] you will be WIPED out. Such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of\\nhenrik] The Armenian Massacres.\\n\\nYou don't realize I can say the same thing about 'The Turkish Massacres.'\\nYes, boys and girls, let's always talk about how bad and nasty things were.\\nLet's do that so we're overwhelmed by anger, and let's do that so our\\nkids will also be hateful.

Shaw  (History),  who  recently\\ncompleted  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the\\nTurkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey\\'s Role in\\nRescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,\\n1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree\\nprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for\\nthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the\\nG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.\\n\\nEditor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and\\nEuropean and Turkish Jews?\\n\\nShaw: Basically, I\\'m  an Ottoman historian, but  I\\'m also Jewish.\\nI\\'ve  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as\\ntime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,\\nI collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a\\ncouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the\\n500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and\\ncoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire\\nAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman\\nJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became\\nmotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The\\nJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book\\nis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who\\ntend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint\\nof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish\\nsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I\\napproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of\\nview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I\\nfinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across\\nadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War\\nII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good\\ndeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not\\nactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in\\nthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish\\ndiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It\\nwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, so\\nI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,\\nmainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the\\nTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second\\nbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped\\nrescue Jews from the Nazis.\\n\\n- How exactly did they do this?\\n\\nThe story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents\\nthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the period\\nbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in\\n1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi\\nGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and\\nthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of\\nreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were\\nbeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new\\ntalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three\\nmonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey\\narranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and\\nwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish\\nuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical\\npersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors\\ncame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political\\nscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in\\nTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the\\nBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,\\ncame to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics\\nin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the\\nNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually\\ncame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other\\nGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.\\nOne  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical\\nproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to\\nTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the\\nTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul\\nHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first\\nphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by\\nTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in\\nTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded\\nthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in\\nthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I\\neven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey\\npraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting\\nthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been\\npersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the\\nNazis\\' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The\\nsecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in\\n1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and\\nespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They\\nhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of\\nthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the\\nTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was\\nthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews\\nthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might\\nhappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled\\nto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their\\nTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the\\nNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of\\nanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not\\nworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot\\nto be a Turkish Jew.\\n\\n- How so?\\n\\nTurkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained\\nits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries\\nuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the\\nend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position\\nto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the\\nactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of\\nthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in\\nparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from\\nthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish\\ncitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were\\narrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats\\nwould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other\\nofficials and say in effect:  \"These people are Turkish citizens.\\nYou  can\\'t do  this  to  them.\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be\\nreleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish\\ndiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.\\n\\nThe Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.\\nThey hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion\\nof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and\\nmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they\\nusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.\\nThe Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps\\nto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded\\ntrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and\\nsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews\\nwere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in\\nParis,  and that\\'s  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish\\nconsuls took place.\\n\\nThe greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned\\ntheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The\\nconsuls couldn\\'t declare that  these people were Turkish citizens\\nbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews\\nlining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get\\npassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their\\nTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so\\nprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantime\\nit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on\\nthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them\\nif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because\\nradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of\\nthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a\\ndocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \"irregular fellow\\ncitizen.\" The  document said in  effect \"This person is  a former\\nTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his\\nTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if\\nyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\"  The\\ndiplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on\\nit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they\\naccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this\\nmeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who\\nhad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.\\n\\nActually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of\\nJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to\\nretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these\\ninterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all\\nJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to\\nprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz\\nbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.\\n\\n- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?\\n\\nThere were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War\\nII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the\\ninformation in this section of  the book relates to the situation\\nin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls\\nsent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in\\nreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would\\npresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are\\nTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the\\nNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish\\nconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from\\nNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran\\nregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas\\nso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were\\noften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern\\nEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these\\ngovernments really didn\\'t want the Jews to escape. As a result of\\nthe Turkish consuls\\' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish\\nJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to\\nAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either\\nescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of\\nsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much\\nbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy\\nfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.\\nIncidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also\\nworked to rescue Jews in that country.\\n\\n- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats\\nacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin\\nfrom Nazi persecution.\\n\\nYes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their\\ninterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their\\ntreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German\\nterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.\\nOn  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not\\ndiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis\\nclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not\\ndiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.\\nTurkey  protested,   saying,  \"You  are  dividing   our  citizens\\naccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that\\nall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.\\nTherefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\" American consuls\\nin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told\\nAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they\\ncouldn\\'t do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were\\nbeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book\\ntakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the\\nHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European\\nJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in\\nPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in\\nIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other\\nJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also\\nsent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These\\ngroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out\\nwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at\\nthat  time people  didn\\'t know  what  was going  on. They  didn\\'t\\nimagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the\\nfirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government let\\nthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and\\nfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out\\nwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the\\nNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received\\nassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who\\nserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to\\n1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican\\nrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the\\nCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was\\ndoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern\\nEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these\\nagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even\\nrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,\\nBulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren\\'t able to help much in\\nPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the\\nPolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for\\nthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the\\nso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through\\nthe Black Sea to Istanbul.\\n\\nTurkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its\\nborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was\\nsuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The\\ngovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the\\nnon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by\\nthe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and\\nPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean\\nfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly\\nopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did\\nnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they\\nfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British\\nconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic\\nand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,\\nyielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For\\nexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700\\nJewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish\\ngovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British\\nambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all\\nwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish\\ngovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to\\npass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during\\nthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these\\nrefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to\\nsend money and food out of the country.\\n\\n- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be\\nliving in Israel.\\n\\nYes, and  their children. But  let\\'s return  for a moment  to the\\nfirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not\\ngo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the\\nnon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en\\nroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.\\n\\n- And you have rescued it from obscurity.\\n\\nMany studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do\\nnot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of\\nthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of\\nwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a\\nmuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the\\npicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to\\nundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.\\n\\nWhen it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively\\nsmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The\\nrescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so\\nsignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were\\nmurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.\\n\\nAbout  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -\\ntranslations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the\\nstory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware\\nof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the\\npeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would\\nnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they\\ncould see the documents.\\n\\n- What languages are used in the documents?\\n\\nMost of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There\\nis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of\\nthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I\\ndid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what\\nTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A\\nfew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did\\nnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in\\nfact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying\\nto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For\\nexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency\\nwas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in\\nhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President\\nRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had\\nbeen an executive of Bloomingdale\\'s  department store in New York\\nCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The\\ndocuments related to his mission are in English.\\n\\nI also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust\\nhistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His\\nfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had\\ngathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn\\'t\\npersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more\\ncan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone\\nsomeday will make the effort.\\n\\n- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn\\'t it?\\n\\nRight. I\\'m  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the\\nOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In\\naddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I\\'ve been actively\\ninvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the\\ncoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I\\nhelped organize  a large international conference  on the subject\\nwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.\\n\\n- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken\\nplace, what do you plan to do next?\\n\\nI\\'m working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War\\nfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the\\nyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the\\nvictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its\\nindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid\\nII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an\\nimportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed\\nall sorts of political movements.\\n\\nStanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in\\nBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning\\na second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate\\nat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School\\nof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the\\nUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the\\nUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to\\nUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the\\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute\\nin  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National\\nEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP.

       " '\\n\\nWell, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.\\n \\nYou have to be very careful about what you mean by \"question authority\".\\nTaken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative,\\nand to say \"I question to word of this authority\" is ridiculous. If it is \\nopen to question, it isn\\'t an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly\\nreasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase\\nhere should be \"authenticate authority.\" Once you have authenticated\\nyour authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as\\nan authority. \\n\\nThe difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You \\ncan perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency\\nin what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of\\ndiscourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in\\ninself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and \\nother that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)\\nI cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, \\nbecause if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don\\'t need an \\nauthority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which\\nI cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must\\ndo it by some means other than by examining its teachings. \\n\\nIn practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don\\'t\\nhave time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist\\nworing today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts\\nof knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to \\nverify for himself.\\n\\nIn spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source \\nofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am\\na Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem\\nthe strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for\\nbelief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).\\n\\nThe atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a\\nreasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.\\nIf you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of\\nevery receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly\\nchange. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. \\n\\nTo demand scintific or rational proof of God\\'s existence, is to deny\\nGod\\'s existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very\\nnature, prove anything.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

As his guilt has not been established, it is\\nwrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.\\n\\n(b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps\\nhave not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is\\n_not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and\\n_in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important \\ndistinction.\\n\\nI should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say \"Muslim\".  In\\ngeneral, anyone who calls themselves a \"Muslim\" and does not do or \\noutwardly profess\\nsomething in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam\\nis considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to\\nIslam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a\\nMuslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential\\nprinciples, though, then one does leave Islam.\\n\\nThe term \"Muslim\" is to be contrasted with \"Mu\\'min\", which means \"true\\nbeliever\".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu\\'min is\\nsomething known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you\\nwill not find the term Mu\\'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism,\\nbecause it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I,\\nfor example, am a \"true believer\" or not.  For example, I could just be\\nputting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to\\nwhat I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say \"Muslims\"\\nwe mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in\\npractice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.

This cultural shift was, in its later\\nstages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that\\njustified\\n them.\\n\\nThere was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of \"economics\" -\\nfrom the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of\\ncreation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces\\nand powers. There were denominational differences among the new\\nworshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was \"the free\\nrein of the market mechanism\", while for others it was \"the\\ndialectical forces of history\". But in both the capitalist West and\\nthe socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of\\nMammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who\\nwere concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to\\noppose what was happening and state their case.\\n\\nSteve',\n",

If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little\\ntest where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked\\npeople with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and\\nshoot a target.

I\\nknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off\\nchance of the gun getting taken away.

       " '[An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]\\n\\n                       April 16, 1993\\n\\n      INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY  \\n                           PROPOSAL\\n\\n       The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement \\non cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of \\nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a \\ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues \\nsuch as export controls which have effectively denied most people \\neasy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues \\nposed by new technology.\\n\\n       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has \\nalready reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before \\nany public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the \\nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone \\nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed \\nby the National Security Agency. The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an \\n80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into \\nchips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow \\nagents would store users\\' keys, and be required to turn them over \\nlaw enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The \\nencryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be \\navailable to any manufacturer for incorporation into their \\ncommunications products.\\n\\n       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\\n\\n       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution \\nbefore conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may \\nnot be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may \\nhave better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the \\ngovernment as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,\\nindependent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets \\nbased on open standards.\\n\\n       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. \\nYet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm \\nclassified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public \\nand open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a \\nstandard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \\n\\n       Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed \\nsystem may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and \\nlaw enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored \\npublicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the \\nsafety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive \\nindividual\\'s fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal \\ninquiries?  \\n\\n       In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the \\nimportance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into \\ndigital privacy and security.  However, the \"Clipper chip\" solution \\nought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before \\nthe discussion even begins.\\n\\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\\n\\nESCROW\\n\\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of \\nwhom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid \\nwarrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts \\nover to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General \\nwill be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the \\nAdministration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal \\nagency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental \\norganization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents \\nyet.\\n\\nKey registration would be done by the manufacturer of the \\ncommunications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person \\nusing it.\\n\\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\\n\\nThe Administration claims that there are no back door means by \\nwhich the government or others could break the code without \\nsecuring keys from the escrow agents and that the President will \\nbe told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order \\nto prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for \\nan all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security \\narrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results \\nof the investigation would then be made public.\\n\\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\\n\\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government \\nbelieves in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big \\ncustomers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, \\nVP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. \\n\\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\\n\\nJerry Berman, Executive Director\\nDaniel J.

       " 'Here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors\\nand provides some additional information and explanation.\\n\\n\\n                     THE CLIPPER CHIP: A TECHNICAL SUMMARY\\n\\n                               Dorothy Denning\\n\\n                           Revised, April 21, 1993\\n\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nOn April 16, the President announced a new initiative that will bring\\ntogether the Federal Government and industry in a voluntary program\\nto provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of\\nlaw enforcement.  At the heart of the plan is a new tamper-proof encryption\\nchip called the \"Clipper Chip\" together with a split-key approach to\\nescrowing keys.  Two escrow agencies are used, and the key parts from\\nboth are needed to reconstruct a key.\\n\\n\\nCHIP CONTENTS\\n\\nThe Clipper Chip contains a classified single-key 64-bit block\\nencryption algorithm called \"Skipjack.\"  The algorithm uses 80 bit keys\\n(compared with 56 for the DES) and has 32 rounds of scrambling\\n(compared with 16 for the DES).  It supports all 4 DES modes of\\noperation.  The algorithm takes 32 clock ticks, and in Electronic\\nCodebook (ECB) mode runs at 12 Mbits per second.\\n\\nEach chip includes the following components:\\n\\n   the Skipjack encryption algorithm\\n   F, an 80-bit family key that is common to all chips\\n   N, a 30-bit serial number (this length is subject to change)\\n   U, an 80-bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip\\n\\nThe chips are programmed by Mykotronx, Inc., which calls them the\\n\"MYK-78.\"  The silicon is supplied by VLSI Technology Inc.  They are\\nimplemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about\\n$30 each in quantities of 10,000 or more.  The price should drop as the\\ntechnology is shrunk to .8 micron.\\n\\n\\nENCRYPTING WITH THE CHIP\\n\\nTo see how the chip is used, imagine that it is embedded in the AT&T\\ntelephone security device (as it will be).  Suppose I call someone and\\nwe both have such a device.  After pushing a button to start a secure\\nconversation, my security device will negotiate an 80-bit session key K\\nwith the device at the other end.  This key negotiation takes place\\nwithout the Clipper Chip.  In general, any method of key exchange can\\nbe used such as the Diffie-Hellman public-key distribution method.\\n\\nOnce the session key K is established, the Clipper Chip is used to\\nencrypt the conversation or message stream M (digitized voice).  The\\ntelephone security device feeds K and M into the chip to produce two\\nvalues:\\n\\n   E[M; K], the encrypted message stream, and \\n   E[E[K; U] + N; F], a law enforcement field , \\n\\nwhich are transmitted over the telephone line.  The law enforcement\\nfield thus contains the session key K encrypted under the unit key U\\nconcatenated with the serial number N, all encrypted under the family\\nkey F.  The law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after\\nan authorized wiretap has been installed.\\n\\nThe ciphertext E[M; K] is decrypted by the receiver\\'s device using the\\nsession key:\\n\\n   D[E[M; K]; K] = M .\\n\\n\\nCHIP PROGRAMMING AND ESCROW\\n\\nAll Clipper Chips are programmed inside a SCIF (Secure Compartmented\\nInformation Facility), which is essentially a vault.  The SCIF contains\\na laptop computer and equipment to program the chips.  About 300 chips\\nare programmed during a single session.  The SCIF is located at\\nMykotronx.\\n\\nAt the beginning of a session, a trusted agent from each of the two key\\nescrow agencies enters the vault.  Agent 1 enters a secret, random\\n80-bit value S1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret, random\\n80-bit value S2. These random values serve as seeds to generate unit\\nkeys for a sequence of serial numbers.  Thus, the unit keys are a\\nfunction of 160 secret, random bits, where each agent knows only 80.\\n  \\nTo generate the unit key for a serial number N, the 30-bit value N is\\nfirst padded with a fixed 34-bit block to produce a 64-bit block N1.\\nS1 and S2 are then used as keys to triple-encrypt N1, producing a\\n64-bit block R1:\\n\\n        R1 = E[D[E[N1; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nSimilarly, N is padded with two other 34-bit blocks to produce N2 and\\nN3, and two additional 64-bit blocks R2 and R3 are computed:  \\n\\n        R2 = E[D[E[N2; S1]; S2]; S1] \\n        R3 = E[D[E[N3; S1]; S2]; S1] .\\n\\nR1, R2, and R3 are then concatenated together, giving 192 bits. The\\nfirst 80 bits are assigned to U1 and the second 80 bits to U2.  The\\nrest are discarded.  The unit key U is the XOR of U1 and U2.  U1 and U2\\nare the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow\\nagencies.\\n\\nAs a sequence of values for U1, U2, and U are generated, they are\\nwritten onto three separate floppy disks.  The first disk contains a\\nfile for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part\\nU1.  The second disk is similar but contains the U2 values.  The third\\ndisk contains the unit keys U.  Agent 1 takes the first disk and agent\\n2 takes the second disk.  Thus each agent walks away knowing\\nan 80-bit seed and the 80-bit key parts.  However, the agent does not\\nknow the other 80 bits used to generate the keys or the other 80-bit\\nkey parts.  \\n\\nThe third disk is used to program the chips.  After the chips are\\nprogrammed, all information is discarded from the vault and the agents\\nleave.  The laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no\\ninformation is left behind.\\n \\nThe protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the\\nroom instead of two.  The first two would provide the seeds S1 and S2,\\nand the second two (the escrow agents) would take the disks back to\\nthe escrow agencies. \\n\\nThe escrow agencies have as yet to be determined, but they will not\\nbe the NSA, CIA, FBI, or any other law enforcement agency.  One or\\nboth may be independent from the government.\\n\\n\\nLAW ENFORCEMENT USE\\n\\nWhen law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line, they\\nwill first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get\\naccess to the communications line.  Let us assume that the tap is in\\nplace and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the\\nClipper Chip.  The law enforcement field is first decrypted with the\\nfamily key F, giving E[K; U] + N.  Documentation certifying that a tap\\nhas been authorized for the party associated with serial number N is\\nthen sent (e.g., via secure FAX) to each of the key escrow agents, who\\nreturn (e.g., also via secure FAX) U1 and U2.  U1 and U2 are XORed\\ntogether to produce the unit key U, and E[K; U] is decrypted to get the\\nsession key K.  Finally the message stream is decrypted.  All this will\\nbe accomplished through a special black box decoder.\\n\\n\\nCAPSTONE: THE NEXT GENERATION\\n\\nA successor to the Clipper Chip, called \"Capstone\" by the government\\nand \"MYK-80\" by Mykotronx, has already been developed.  It will include\\nthe Skipjack algorithm, the Digital Signature Standard (DSS), the\\nSecure Hash Algorithm (SHA), a method of key exchange, a fast\\nexponentiator, and a randomizer.  A prototoype will be available for\\ntesting on April 22, and the chips are expected to be ready for\\ndelivery in June or July.\\n',\n",

In fact, for the Bible to be of\\nany use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a\\nworkable moral system created for everyday use.\\n\\nThe Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing\\nevery word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of\\nIsrael were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial\\nLaws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance\\nof moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.\\n\\nIt seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-\\nChristian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from\\nthe diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well\\nbe an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to\\nfollow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was\\nwritten down by man.\\n\\nThis leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the\\ndivine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many\\ndifferent ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the\\nfifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do\\nthat to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an\\nagnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit\\nsociety (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take\\nthe basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create\\nand justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables\\nthe people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers\\nhave done).\\n\\nWhatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I\\nthink the important aspect is the result.\\n\\nDavid.\\n\\n---\\nOn religion:',\n",

Chance would have it that \"my weekend\" with my \\ndaughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.\\n\\nAlthough I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided\\nthat the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith\\nwas too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a\\ndate), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.\\n\\nDuring the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. \\n\\nWhen our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she \\nbe baptised as Catholic. This wasn\\'t a problem with me.\\n\\nDuring a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease\\nthat affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for\\ntwo months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \"effectively\".\\n\\nIn other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.\\n\\nDuring the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over\\nmy daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday\\nvisitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study\\nbooks to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.\\n\\nLast fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.\\nAt that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time,\\nI started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.\\nI did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a\\nreligious community.\\n\\nToday, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for \\nCommunion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine\\n(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then\\nballed the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the\\npew in front of us.\\n\\nI feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her\\nreligious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments\\nif you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.\\n\\nMy daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and\\nmature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly\\nfor religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with\\nmy daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.\\n\\nMy initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith\\nin Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I\\nwould never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays\\nwith her again.\\n\\nI do not want to \"drive her from the fold\", and would be willing to allow her\\nto continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only\\nfor two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.\\n\\nAny suggestions?\\n\\nIf you have a response, please e-mail me a copy.

       " 'A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.\\nSince he isn\\'t in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post\\nit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\\nsort a directory listing?\\n',\n",
